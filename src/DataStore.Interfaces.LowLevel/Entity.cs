    ///     the benefit of an interface over an abstract class is you can't sneak logic into it.

    ///     Furthermore, if you expose add any logic to the base class, even that which is
    ///     serialisation safe, if a client has models assemblies each with a different version
    ///     of this logic, your code could start producing unexpected results.
    ///     So, NO LOGIC of any kind in these abstract classes.
